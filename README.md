## Weather APP Created on SWIFTUI

The Weather Forecast App is a mobile application that provides users with up-to-date weather information for a specific location. It offers a 5-day weather forecast with data available in 3-hour intervals, making it easy for users to plan their activities and stay informed about weather conditions.

Key features of the app include the following:

1. **5-Day Forecast**: The app displays a 5-day weather forecast, showing conditions for each day at 3-hour intervals. This detailed forecast allows users to prepare for various weather changes throughout the day.

2. **Temperature in Celsius**: The temperature is presented in Celsius, providing a common and widely used metric for weather-related information.

3. **Location Services**: Core Location, a framework in iOS, is employed to determine the longitude and latitude of the user's current location. This ensures that the app can provide weather information tailored to the user's vicinity.

4. **MVVM Pattern**: The app is designed following the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern. This separation of concerns helps maintain a clean and organized codebase, making it easier to develop, test, and maintain the application.

5. **API Integration**: The app fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API (https://api.openweathermap.org). This API provides real-time and accurate weather information, enabling the app to present reliable forecasts to users.

In summary, the Weather Forecast App is a user-friendly tool that leverages Core Location to deliver location-specific weather information. It offers a 5-day forecast with temperature data in Celsius and adheres to the MVVM pattern for efficient development and maintenance. By utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API, the app ensures that users receive timely and precise weather updates, enhancing their ability to plan and make informed decisions based on current weather conditions..
